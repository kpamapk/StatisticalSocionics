  <p class="mb-4">
    Socionics defines eight Information Elements, or functions, that describe how people perceive and process information. Each is a unique way of interpreting reality, and each type uses them in a specific order defined by Model A.
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
    <li><strong>Ne – Extroverted Intuition:</strong> perceives potential, novelty, and abstract possibilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Ni – Introverted Intuition:</strong> focuses on internal time patterns, insights, and inevitable trends.</li>
    <li><strong>Se – Extroverted Sensing:</strong> monitors real-time physical presence, force, and external control.</li>
    <li><strong>Si – Introverted Sensing:</strong> internal sensations, comfort, and physical well-being.</li>
    <li><strong>Te – Extroverted Logic (Thinking):</strong> facts, efficiency, and objective data.</li>
    <li><strong>Ti – Introverted Logic (Thinking):</strong> abstract systems, consistency, and logical structure.</li>
    <li><strong>Fe – Extroverted Ethics (Feeling):</strong> emotional atmosphere, social expression, and outward mood.</li>
    <li><strong>Fi – Introverted Ethics (Feeling):</strong> inner values, relationships, and personal feelings.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-4">
    Each of these functions plays a different role in each personality type (e.g. Base, Creative, Vulnerable), making up the functional stack described in Model A.
